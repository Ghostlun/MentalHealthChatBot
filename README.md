# MyChatBotCreation Project

This project involves developing an AI-driven chatbot for mental health diagnosis and recommendations using machine learning models trained on two primary datasets:

1. **Mental Health Synthetic Dataset** (loaded as `mental_df`)
2. **Mental Health Counsel Chatbot Dataset** (loaded as `counsel_df`)

## Initial Data Preparation

The **Mental Health Synthetic Dataset** (`mental_df`) contains the following columns:

- `User ID`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Symptoms`, `Duration (weeks)`, `Previous Diagnosis`, `Therapy History`, `Medication`, `Diagnosis / Condition`, `Suggested Therapy`, `Self-care Advice`, `Urgency Level`, `Mood`, `Stress Level`

This dataset is used primarily for building diagnostic and recommendation models based on user symptoms and demographic data.

## Step 1: Encoding Data for Model Training

Since the original data in `mental_df` was mostly in string format, I encoded categorical variables to numerical values for model compatibility. This process involved:

1. **Diagnosis Encoding**: Mapping diagnosis types to numerical labels.
2. **Symptom Encoding**: Converting symptom descriptions to numerical labels.
3. **Self-care and Therapy Advice Encoding**: Encoding recommendations for self-care and therapy.

```python
def build_self_test_self_care_advice():
    le_diagnosis = LabelEncoder()
    le_symptoms = LabelEncoder()
    le_self_care = LabelEncoder()
    le_therapy = LabelEncoder()

    # Encoding columns
    mental_df['Diagnosis_encoded'] = le_diagnosis.fit_transform(mental_df['Diagnosis'])
    mental_df['Symptoms_encoded'] = le_symptoms.fit_transform(mental_df['Symptoms'])
    mental_df['Self_Care_Advice_encoded'] = le_self_care.fit_transform(mental_df['Self_Care_Advice'])
    mental_df['Suggested_Therapy_encoded'] = le_therapy.fit_transform(mental_df['Suggested_Therapy'])

    # Model training setup
    X = mental_df[['Diagnosis_encoded', 'Symptoms_encoded']]
    y_self_care = mental_df['Self_Care_Advice_encoded']
    y_therapy = mental_df['Suggested_Therapy_encoded']

    X_train, X_test, y_self_care_train, y_self_care_test, y_therapy_train, y_therapy_test = train_test_split(X, y_self_care, y_therapy, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Train models
    model_self_care = RandomForestClassifier()
    model_therapy = RandomForestClassifier()

    model_self_care.fit(X_train, y_self_care_train)
    model_therapy.fit(X_train, y_therapy_train)

    # Predictions
    self_care_pred = model_self_care.predict(X_test)
    therapy_pred = model_therapy.predict(X_test)
```

### **Benefits of Encoding**

Encoding data allows models like RandomForest to understand the categorical relationships between features. By converting text-based data into numerical values, the model can learn patterns effectively without being hindered by incompatible data types.

### **Initial Model Results**

- **Accuracy**: Initial self-care and therapy advice prediction accuracy was low (~20%).
- **Insight**: The low accuracy indicated that `mental_df` might lack strong patterns for recommendations due to limited data diversity in these fields.

## Step 2: Improved Model for Diagnosis Prediction

Given the low accuracy of self-care and therapy advice predictions, I pivoted to focus on diagnosing users based on a broader range of features.

### **Data Grouping and Re-Mapping**

To improve prediction accuracy, I grouped diagnoses and previous diagnoses into higher-level categories:

```python
def group_diagnosis(row):
    if row['Diagnosis'] in ['Panic Disorder', 'Anxiety']:
        return 'Anxiety Disorders'
    elif row['Diagnosis'] in ['Depression', 'Burnout']:
        return 'Mood Disorders'
    elif row['Diagnosis'] == 'Stress':
        return 'Stress-Related Disorders'

def group_prev_diagnosis(row):
    if row['Prev_Diagnosis'] in ['Panic Disorder', 'Anxiety', 'OCD']:
        return 'Anxiety Disorders'
    elif row['Prev_Diagnosis'] in ['Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder']:
        return 'Mood Disorders'
    elif row['Prev_Diagnosis'] in ['Stress', 'PTSD']:
        return 'Stress-Related Disorders'
    else:
        return ''
```

### **Label Encoding for Diagnosis and Related Fields**

```python
def improved_test_reports_diagnosis(mental_df):
    mental_df["Diagnosis_Group"] = mental_df.apply(group_diagnosis, axis=1)
    mental_df['Prev_Diagnosis_Group'] = mental_df.apply(group_prev_diagnosis, axis=1)
    mental_df["Re_Gender"] = mental_df.apply(re_map_gender, axis=1)
    mental_df["Urgency_Level"] = mental_df.apply(re_map_urgency_level, axis=1)

    le_diagnosis_group = LabelEncoder()
    le_prev_diagnosis_group = LabelEncoder()
    le_symptoms = LabelEncoder()

    mental_df['Diagnosis_Group_encoded'] = le_diagnosis_group.fit_transform(mental_df['Diagnosis_Group'])
    mental_df['Prev_Diagnosis_Group_encoded'] = le_prev_diagnosis_group.fit_transform(mental_df['Prev_Diagnosis'])
    mental_df['Symptoms_encoded'] = le_symptoms.fit_transform(mental_df['Symptoms'])

    # Train Data Preparation
    X = mental_df[['Age', 'Symptoms_encoded', "Re_Gender", "Prev_Diagnosis_Group_encoded", "Duration", "Stress_Level", "Urgency_Level"]]
    y_diagnosis = mental_df['Diagnosis_Group_encoded']

    X_train, X_test, y_diagnosis_train, y_diagnosis_test = train_test_split(X, y_diagnosis, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Model Training
    model_diagnosis = RandomForestClassifier()
    model_diagnosis.fit(X_train, y_diagnosis_train)

    # Predictions and Evaluation
    diagnos_pred = model_diagnosis.predict(X_test)
    print("Diagnosis Group Classification Report:")
    diagnosis_report = classification_report(y_diagnosis_test, diagnos_pred, target_names=le_diagnosis_group.classes_)
    print(diagnosis_report)

    return model_diagnosis, le_diagnosis_group, diagnosis_report
```

### **Benefits of Grouping Diagnoses**

Grouping diagnoses reduces data sparsity and increases the likelihood of identifying meaningful patterns by clustering related conditions into broader categories (e.g., Anxiety, Mood Disorders). This approach improves model performance and provides a more generalized diagnosis output, which can still guide users effectively.

### **Model Results**

- **Accuracy**: Diagnosis model accuracy improved to around 40%.
- **Benefit**: With broader categories, the model gains better predictive power by leveraging the common characteristics within each diagnosis group.

## Summary of Benefits and Model Use

- **Label Encoding**: Necessary for model compatibility and to represent categorical data numerically.
- **Grouping and Re-Mapping**: Helped improve the prediction by consolidating data into categories that reflect real-world diagnoses.
- **RandomForestClassifier**: Offers robustness and flexibility with categorical data, making it an ideal choice for the diagnosis model.

With this approach, the chatbot can now use user-provided information to predict and suggest diagnosis groups, such as:
- **Anxiety Disorders**
- **Stress-Related Disorders**
- **Mood Disorders**

This structured approach ensures that the chatbot offers relevant diagnoses and recommendations based on the user's input, even with the limited dataset accuracy constraints.
